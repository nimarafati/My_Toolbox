# File formats  
From ChatGPT:  
The CZI (Carl Zeiss Image) format is a file format developed by Carl Zeiss Microscopy for storing multidimensional microscopy images. It was specifically designed to handle the large amounts of data generated by modern microscopy techniques, such as confocal and multiphoton microscopy.  

CZI files are based on the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) standard, which allows for efficient storage and organization of large datasets. They can store multiple channels, z-stacks (multiple focal planes), time series, and other dimensions, making them suitable for capturing complex imaging data.  

Some key features of the CZI format include:  

1. Metadata Preservation: CZI files retain detailed metadata about the acquisition settings, microscope parameters, and experimental conditions, allowing for reproducibility and data analysis.  

2. Lossless Compression: CZI files use lossless compression algorithms to reduce file size without sacrificing image quality. This compression is advantageous for storing large datasets while maintaining high fidelity.  

In addition to CZI, there are numerous other image file formats used in the field of microscopy and beyond. Some commonly encountered formats include:  

1. TIFF (Tagged Image File Format): TIFF is a widely supported format that allows for flexible storage of images and associated metadata. It supports various compression methods, color spaces, and bit depths.  

2. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): JPEG is a commonly used format for storing photographic images. It utilizes lossy compression, which reduces file size but may result in a slight loss of image quality.  

3. PNG (Portable Network Graphics): PNG is a lossless image format that supports both grayscale and color images. It is widely used for web graphics and images that require transparency.  

4. BMP (Bitmap): BMP is a relatively simple format that stores images as uncompressed pixel data. It is commonly used in Windows environments but is less efficient for large datasets.  

5. GIF (Graphics Interchange Format): GIF is a format primarily used for animated images. It supports a limited color palette and uses lossless compression.  

6. DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine): DICOM is a specialized format for medical imaging, commonly used in radiology. It includes not only image data but also metadata related to patient information, acquisition parameters, and more.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other image formats available, each with its own strengths and applications. The choice of format depends on factors such as the type of data, intended use, compatibility requirements, and desired trade-off between image quality and file size.

# Compression formats  
## Lossless
This is a reversible compression where there is no loss of information (2 - 10 times compressed).  
## Lossy  
As names explains it is non-reversible compression method which some information may be lost (10 - 30 times compressed).  


# Multiplex Immunofluorescence and Multispectral Imaging
**Double-Dispensing:**
Double-dispensing is a technique used in automated immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining systems to apply reagents, such as antibodies or dyes, to tissue samples. It involves dispensing a specific reagent, for example, a primary antibody, washing the tissue to remove excess reagent, and then dispensing another reagent. This process can be repeated several times with different reagents, allowing for the sequential staining of multiple targets within the same tissue section. It is an essential step in multiplex staining to ensure that each target is labeled with the appropriate antibody or fluorophore.

**Double-Dispensing Primary Antibodies:**
When performing multiplex staining using the double-dispensing technique, primary antibodies specific to different target proteins are sequentially applied to the tissue sample. Each primary antibody recognizes a unique target, and after each dispensing step, the sample is washed to remove excess unbound antibodies before the next primary antibody is applied. This process enables the visualization of multiple proteins in the same tissue section, each with its unique antibody.

**BOND RX:**
BOND RX is an automated immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining platform developed by Leica Biosystems. It is designed for high-throughput, reliable, and standardized staining of tissue samples. BOND RX can be used for single or multiplex staining and offers features like precise reagent dispensing, incubation, and washing steps, making it well-suited for multiplex staining techniques, including double-dispensing. The system is used in research, clinical pathology, and diagnostics to analyze tissue samples for various biomarkers.

**Opal Fluorophores:**
Opal fluorophores are a set of fluorescent dyes specifically designed for multiplex immunofluorescence staining. These dyes are developed by PerkinElmer and are compatible with automated staining platforms like the BOND RX. Opal fluorophores are used in conjunction with primary antibodies to label specific target proteins in tissue samples. What makes Opal fluorophores unique is their spectral properties, which allow for the sequential imaging and quantification of multiple targets with minimal spectral overlap. Each Opal fluorophore has a distinct emission and can be used in combination to visualize different targets simultaneously.



# Translating Multispectral mIF into the Clinic  
Requirements can be summarized into five categories: (1) flexibility to fully explore co-expression and spatial information; (2) analytical performance providing reproducibility and robustness; (3) workflow and standardization to support laboratory needs; (4) demonstrated clinical validation and utility; and (5) reimbursement from payers to support laboratory economics and clinical adoption.
