# File formats  
From ChatGPT:  
The CZI (Carl Zeiss Image) format is a file format developed by Carl Zeiss Microscopy for storing multidimensional microscopy images. It was specifically designed to handle the large amounts of data generated by modern microscopy techniques, such as confocal and multiphoton microscopy.  

CZI files are based on the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) standard, which allows for efficient storage and organization of large datasets. They can store multiple channels, z-stacks (multiple focal planes), time series, and other dimensions, making them suitable for capturing complex imaging data.  

Some key features of the CZI format include:  

1. Metadata Preservation: CZI files retain detailed metadata about the acquisition settings, microscope parameters, and experimental conditions, allowing for reproducibility and data analysis.  

2. Lossless Compression: CZI files use lossless compression algorithms to reduce file size without sacrificing image quality. This compression is advantageous for storing large datasets while maintaining high fidelity.  

In addition to CZI, there are numerous other image file formats used in the field of microscopy and beyond. Some commonly encountered formats include:  

1. TIFF (Tagged Image File Format): TIFF is a widely supported format that allows for flexible storage of images and associated metadata. It supports various compression methods, color spaces, and bit depths.  

2. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): JPEG is a commonly used format for storing photographic images. It utilizes lossy compression, which reduces file size but may result in a slight loss of image quality.  

3. PNG (Portable Network Graphics): PNG is a lossless image format that supports both grayscale and color images. It is widely used for web graphics and images that require transparency.  

4. BMP (Bitmap): BMP is a relatively simple format that stores images as uncompressed pixel data. It is commonly used in Windows environments but is less efficient for large datasets.  

5. GIF (Graphics Interchange Format): GIF is a format primarily used for animated images. It supports a limited color palette and uses lossless compression.  

6. DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine): DICOM is a specialized format for medical imaging, commonly used in radiology. It includes not only image data but also metadata related to patient information, acquisition parameters, and more.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other image formats available, each with its own strengths and applications. The choice of format depends on factors such as the type of data, intended use, compatibility requirements, and desired trade-off between image quality and file size.

# Compression formats  
## Lossless
This is a reversible compression where there is no loss of information (2 - 10 times compressed).  
## Lossy  
As names explains it is non-reversible compression method which some information may be lost (10 - 30 times compressed).
