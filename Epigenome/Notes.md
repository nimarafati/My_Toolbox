# Methylation   
## Acronyms  
WGBS, Methyl-Seq, BS-seq are referring to whole genome screen/sequencing of methylome.  

## Library prep  
- SPLAT works well for small genomes  
- EM-Seq has high-throughput   

## Important points  
- For normalization keep purity and methylation level into account  


## WBGS  
Directional library prep results in specifically sequencing strand.
