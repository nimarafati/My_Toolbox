# Anatomy  
## Regions of spine
**Cervical** uppermost part of spine (C1-C7)  
**Thoracic** or dorsal is the middle part of spine (T1-T12)  
**Lumbar** Lower part of spine (L1-L5)  
# Immunology  
## Resident immune cells  
Cells adapted to local environment (tissues) and respond to pathogenes within that tissue.   
### Macrophages  
These immune cells are phygocytic, engulf and digest the cellular debris and pathogens.  Examples are Kupffer cells in liver, alveolar macrophages in lungs, microglia in brain.  
### Dendritic cells  
These immune cells present antigenes to other immune cells which triggers iimmune response.  These cells exist in lungs, intestine, skin,...   
### Mast cells  
These immune cells respond to allergic elements and parasites. These cells exist in skin, digestive tract, respiratory tract, and other connective tissues.  

## Non-resident immune cells
Despite of resident cells, these cells migrate through blood.  
### Neutrophils  
One of the main white blood cells responding to infection or inflammation.  
### B and T cells  
These cells are important part of **adaptive** immunity. They originate in thymus (B cells) and bone marrow (T cells).  
### Natural killers  
These cells are important part of **innate** immunity.  These cells are involved in response to infection and cancer.
